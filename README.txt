Hi,

This is my attempt at creating an AI to play tictactoe in Pygame. 
It uses the minimax algorithm to calculate all the possible moves left in the game and finds the move that has the highest chance of winning. 
It's not very efficient and isn't optimized with alpha-beta pruning, but it should work (hopefully).

Have a good one!
